# UFOs
javascript intro

## Overview
- The endeavor of this project was to build a website that tracks UFO sightings across North America, and allows the user to filter the website's information by date, city, state, country, and shape of the sighted Unidentified Flying Object. 

## Results
- A user will notice the filter search section to the left of the page. Here they can easily type in relevant filters. 
- Keep in mind that these filters should be typed in lowercase, to match the data that we have stored in our table. 
- Below is an example of the results returned when the filters "ca" (state), and "light" (shape) are input.


## Summary
It is hard to tell what the concentration of the sightings may be at a glance. To strengthen the utility and impact of the website, building visualizations (perhaps a map with markers of each sighting in the dataset, or a timelapse of the sightings to show if there were any particular times in history that sightings were more prevalent) could be made and included. Furthermore, the website does not track new sightings. There should be an attachment of some type of updatable database so that new data can be added as time passes.
